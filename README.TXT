Project Description: 
	This project was altered from the ch.8 project and I added more code upon to 
	finish the project.  You are able to place a coffee order and use the dev 
	console to make orders or use the UI to create orders, and then the orders
	get stacked into the checklist.  

	For the other form, you enter all the required information and it a pop-up
	box will appear and thank you for payment.
